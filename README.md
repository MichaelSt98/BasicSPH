# BasicSPH

**BasicSPH** is a basic implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH).

## SPH

See [SPH introduction](documents/SPH_intro.pdf)as reference.<sup>[1](#sph_intro_footnote)</sup>

[SPH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) is a computational method for solving partial differential equations ([PDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)). It's a meshfree Lagrangian method, which makes it ideal to simulate problems dominated by complex boundary dynamics.
